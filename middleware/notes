1.so basically these function promote authenticity a way of identifiying the user
1.2 any action that needs to happen before something happen
2.next simply means do something an move to the other thing
2.1 the middleware work hand in hand with the routes


useCases of steps that happen when using the middleware
wants to like a post
//click the like btn =>auth middleware (next) =>liike Controller
the auth is going to call next only if it does not throw an error
N.B all the things we set inthe middleware will be presennt in the  next action eg req.userId will 
be present in the next thing that will be called...
